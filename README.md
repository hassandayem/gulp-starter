# gulp-starter

I made this starter to bootstrap my upcoming projects using gulp.
The configuration is simple and it covers the most important concepts to build production-ready projects.

## What does it do?
1. It compiles sass files to CSS
2. It autoprefixes the CSS for better compatibility with browsers.
3. It converts the produced CSS file to an RTL version using the [RTLCSS](https://rtlcss.com) script.
4. It transpires all the JavaScript files to a cross-browsers compatible version, and it minifies it as well.
5. It optimizes all the images in the src directory.
